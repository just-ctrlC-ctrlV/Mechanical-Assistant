```bash
streamlit run home.py
```

## Functionality

The repository consists of the following key files:

- `home.py`: Contains the main Streamlit application for the Mechanical Assistant.
- `llamaindex/`
  - `embeddings.py`: Handles setting up the embedding model.
  - `indexing.py`: Manages the creation and loading of the index.
  - `llm.py`: Connects to the LLAMA language model.
  - `loading_data.py`: Loads documents and repository data.
  - `main.py`: Main functionality for the assistant application.
  - `querying.py`: Handles querying the index with user input.
